* Implementations of merge-sort in Standard ML

Please feel free to add more implementations! Corrections and comments are also
welcome! The examples in here so far were run on [[http://www.smlnj.org/][SML/NJ]], and, at least
~list-merge-sort.sml~ uses some syntax specific to SML/NJ.

** Contents

*** Merge-sort on polymorphic lists

~list-merge-sort.sml~ attempts a nice, clean implementation of merge-sort on
polymorphic lists in a functional style.

*** Merge-sort on integer array

~array-merge-sort.sml~ is a pretty ugly attempt at forcing SML into an
imperative idiom. It is an exercise on working with mutable arrays in an
imperative style. To that end, I implement a goofy fragment of an imperative
DSL.

** Dependencies

- ~list-merge-sort.sml~ and ~array-merge-sort.sml~ both use some structures
provides by a little utility library I cultivate for convenience and learning:
