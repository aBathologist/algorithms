# Strongly Connected Components

This folder contains test cases to help in testing the strongly
connected component algorithm. 

## Folder & File structure

The folder name (i.e. `four_conponents`) refer to the number of
strongly compoenents each file the graph as. 

The file names (i.e. `4_3_3_1_0.txt`) refer to the number of verticies
in the strongly connected component, in decending order. So for the
example, The graph has four strongly connected components, and the
first strongly connected component has four verticies, the second has
three, the third (also) has three, the fourth has one, and the last
has none since there are only four strongly connected components.
